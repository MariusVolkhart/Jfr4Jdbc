# Introduction

To support JDBC 4.2 on Java 8 and JDBC 4.3 on Java 11, you need to build this on Java 11.
Java 9 and 10 are no longer supported.

To reduce the dependency, you need to use both pom.xml in root directory and one in jfr4jdbc-driver directory.

# Test

In root directory of Jfr4Jdbc, you can test this as usual.

```shell
mvn test
```

# Build

In jfr4jdbc-driver directory, you can build this as multi release JAR file.

```shell
cd jfr4jdbc-driver
mvn package
```
